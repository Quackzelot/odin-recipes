        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Pelmeni are traditional Russian dumplings made with a simple dough of
          flour, water, eggs, and salt. Typically, they are stuffed with a
          filling of ground pork, chicken, turkey, or beef seasoning with onions
          and salt and pepper.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Make dough: Combine egg, oil, and salt in a liquid measuring cup;
            add enough warm water to fill to 1 cup. Pour into a large bowl and
            knead in 3 cups flour until smooth and elastic. Cover with a dish
            towel and let dough rest for 30 minutes
          </li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, make filling: Combine ground beef, onion, water, salt,
            and pepper in a medium bowl; mix thoroughly by hand or using a fork.
            Set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dust a baking sheet lightly with 1 tablespoon flour; set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Roll out a portion of dough very thinly on a lightly floured
            surface; keep remaining dough covered with a dish towel to avoid
            drying out. Cut out 2 1/2-inch rounds with a cookie cutter. Place
            about 1 teaspoon filling on one side of each dough circle. Fold
            dough over and seal the edges using your fingers, forming a
            crescent. Join the ends and pinch them together. Place on the
            prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.
            Freeze pelmeni for 30 minutes to prevent them from sticking
            together.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a simmer. Working in
            batches, cook frozen pelmeni in simmering water until meat is cooked
            through and pelmeni float to the top, about 5 minutes. Continue
            cooking for 5 minutes. Transfer to serving plates using a slotted
            spoon
