        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Uzbek plov, the national dish of Uzbekistan, is a flavorful and hearty
          rice dish cooked with meat, carrots, onion, and various spices. It's
          often served in large cast-iron pots called "kazans" and is considered

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Place basmati rice in a large bowl; cover with warm water and set
            aside. Wash whole heads garlic; set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat vegetable oil in a Dutch oven or large skillet over high heat
            until smoking. Add lamb; cook, turning occasionally, until evenly
            browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in onions; cook and stir until
            softened and browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in carrots; cook and
            stir until softened, about 10 minutes. Add barberries, cumin,
            coriander, and peppercorns; drop whole heads garlic into Dutch oven,
            stirring to evenly distribute. Reduce heat to medium. Cover and cook
            30 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wash and drain basmati rice with hot water; add to Dutch oven in an
            even layer on top of lamb. Slowly pour in 2 cups boiling water. The
            rice should be covered with about 3/4-inch water. Do not stir.
            Season with salt; reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and cook until
            rice is tender and liquid absorbed, about 20 minutes. Stir rice and
            lamb together; serve with whole garlic heads on top.
